# Recommendation Systems using Python

## How to run the code:

1. Install Python in Local Computer. Preferably latest version. We are using 3.9.11
2. Install Tensorflow, Pytorch, Sklearn, Scikit, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy using Pip or Conda package Installer
3. Set path in the environment variables
4. Clone the repository into a folder
5. The files CNN.py, HMM.py, KNN.py, LSTM.py and ReinforcementLearning.py are the main file of the project
6. Dataset can be found at kaggle (H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations): https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations 
7. We have uploaded our results in Results folder. The performance of the models can be seen in Graphs folder 

pip Commands:

-    pip install tensorflow
-    pip install torch
-    pip install sklearn
-    pip install pandas
-    pip install numpy
-    pip install matplotlib
